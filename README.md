hit and sunk!

## Rules
The game consists of:

2 Players, player 1 starts first<br />
Each player has a grid on which to place ships<br />
The game begins once both players have placed their ships<br />
The players take turns choosing a position on the opponent’s grid to attack<br />

The result of an attack must be one of:

"Hit" if the opponent has a ship covering the position<br />
"Miss" if there is no ship covering the position<br />
"Already Taken" if the position has previously been attacked “Sunk” if all the positions a ship covers have been hit<br />
"Win" if all the ships on the opponent's grid have been sunk<br />

## Gameplay

Player 1 will start out placing all of their ships, then Player 2 will follow. Once both players have set their ships in place, the game will start with Player 1 taking the first shot. Players will alternate turns until the someone has sunk all of the other players ships!

Simple, right? So let's play! `npm start`
